# OpenJS AI Collaboration Space

Welcome to the **OpenJS AI Collaboration Space**, a community hub where people from across the ecosystem come together to explore how JavaScript powers the future of AI.

From web apps to AI agents, JavaScript is the connective tissue that brings advanced AI systems to billions of people. This space brings together developers, maintainers, and policy thinkers to shape how JavaScript and AI evolve together.

## Goals

The AI Collaboration Space seeks to:

- **Empower developers and maintainers** to responsibly integrate AI into open source and web projects.  
- **Develop best practices** for security and building AI-driven applications.  
- **Highlight JavaScript’s role in AI**, from front-end interfaces to back-end orchestration of large models and agents.  
- **Participate in emerging policy developments** around the responsible use of AI.  
- **Establish strategic partnerships** with AI organizations to support the OpenJS Foundation and its projects.  

## This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to provide a central place for coordination and documentation around JavaScript and AI, and resources for the JavaScript community and beyond.

If you’re interested in JavaScript and AI, join us **bi-weekly on Mondays, 9:30 am Pacific**.  
Check out the schedule on the [OpenJS public calendar](https://calendar.openjsf.org).

Interested parties can also join our **#ai-collab-space** channel on Slack.
